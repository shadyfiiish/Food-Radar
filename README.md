# Food-Radar
The current version of Food Radar is in its initial stages, offering a limited set of restaurants in Frederick with names, food styles, and ratings from Google Maps. The software currently supports popular styles like American, Asian, Italian, Indian, and Mexican. However, ongoing work involves expanding the restaurant dataset, providing users with more options.

Users input their preferred food style and minimum ratings, and the software generates a list of matching restaurants. While functional, there are plans for ongoing refinements to improve accuracy and efficiency.

Food Radar aims to provide easy access to the best-rated restaurants in Frederick, focusing on small and local businesses. Future updates will include a more extensive restaurant list and further enhancements to solidify its position as a reliable tool for finding quality dining experiences in the local area.
